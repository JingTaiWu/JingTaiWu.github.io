          <h1>A Little History</h1>
          I was born and raised in Shanghai, China. My family moved to Honolulu in 2005.
          At the time, I just finished elementary school in China, so I was a bit nervous about going
          to American schools. Fortunately throughout middle school and high school, I had amazing teachers who helped me overcome the difficulties.
          <h1>Why New York?</h1>
          People that I meet in New York tend to ask the one common question: Why did you come all the way from Hawaii
          to New York? It's a paradise there!<br>
          <br>
          Hawaii is a paradise. That's true, but people usually forget that it is also a very small state. There are only
          a few things to do here and it gets boring very easily. When I was applying for colleges during
          senior year of high school, I reminded myself to only target schools outside of Hawaii and
          I am fortunate enough to find Marist College.
